# Get Started<a name="notebooks-get-started"></a>

 To get started, you or your organization's administrator need to complete the SageMaker Studio onboarding process\. You can use either of the following authentication modes: AWS Single Sign\-On \(AWS SSO\) or AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\)\. When choosing the appropriate method for your team, you must carefully consider the advantages of each method\. Switching to another authentication method after you set up the domain requires a manual migration of the team's notebooks so you want to make sure you choose the appropriate method at the start\. For more information, see [Onboard to Amazon SageMaker Studio](gs-studio-onboard.md)\. 

 You can access an Amazon SageMaker Studio notebook in any of the following ways: 
+ You receive an email invitation to access Studio through your organization's AWS SSO account, which includes a direct link to login to Studio without having to use the Amazon SageMaker console\. You can proceed to the [Next Steps](#notebooks-get-started-next-steps)\.
+ You receive a link to a shared Studio notebook, which includes a direct link to log in to Studio without having to use the Amazon SageMaker console\. You can proceed to the [Next Steps](#notebooks-get-started-next-steps)\. 
+ You onboard to Studio and then log in to the Amazon SageMaker console\. For more information, see [Onboard to Amazon SageMaker Studio](gs-studio-onboard.md)\.
